# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimates were often a little optimistic.
I’d usually underestimate how long debugging or testing would take, even if the coding part itself wasn’t too bad.



### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the semester went on, I got better at accounting for the full task, not just the coding. 
I started to include time for reading instructions, debugging, and reviewing code, which made my estimates more realistic

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned how important it is to plan for unexpected issues. Even small tasks can take longer when you're 
learning something new, and padding estimates a little helps avoid last-minute stress.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It helped me spot things I’d missed in my own work, especially around readability and consistent naming.
Sometimes I’d overlook something because I was too close to the code, so getting feedback was really valuable.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

eviewing others’ code helped me become more critical of my own. I saw different approaches to the same task and 
picked up cleaner or more efficient ways of doing things

### Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I loved most things but as the final exam is on paper I expect you guys to have more practices based questions 
and stuffs to provide . Moreover I was disappointed with the teaching styles as I expected more on paper practise
as the exams are on paper

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I kept up with the weekly tasks consistently and made sure to review the feedback. I also improved my testing skills a lot and got more comfortable using classes and files by the later weeks.
