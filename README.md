## ðŸ’¡ Clean Code Lessons Learned

- Use **meaningful variable and function names** to make code easier to read and understand.
- Follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** â€” each function/class should do one thing well.
- Write **modular code** by breaking large programs into manageable functions with clear purposes.
- Use **docstrings** and **comments** to explain what your code does and why.
- **Reformat and lint code** to ensure readability and consistency.

## âœ… How to Use

Each folder (e.g. `prac_01`, `prac_02`, ...) contains tasks completed during that week's practical.  
To run a program, navigate to that folder and run the relevant `.py` file with Python 3.
